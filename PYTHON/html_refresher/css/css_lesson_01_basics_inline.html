 You can apply the style on a html tag using the style attribute.
 So you have to look up the css documentation to see what styles can be applied,

Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever
    undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310
    million-$330 million),[3] the entire project took eight years, with the filming
    for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand,
    Jackson's native country.[4] Each film in the series also had special
    extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical

    some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and
    deviations from the source material.
